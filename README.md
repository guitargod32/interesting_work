Audit_downloader is a web crawler I wrote that was designed to automatically download student degree audits given a list of credentials.
This project was put on indefenite hold because of red tape concerning student data: It was passed as part of the Audit Now software to a future cohort at Bellevue College and the hope is that eventually this will be used to save student advisors at Bellevue College from the trouble of manually opening and downloading each student's Degree Audit every quarter.

populate_mongo_gui is a small program for uploading data to a mongoDB NoSQL database. The script has a gui interface and saves backups of the data, can handle multiple file types, and can create new or modify existing collections in a mongo database. The proccess has also been started (see bottom of project) to let this script read directly from Google docs rather than a local machine.
